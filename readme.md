This game is played by clicking on the crystals of random values to match the target number. Each crystal is a random number that adds to their value. If the  value matches the target number a win is logged but if the player's value goes over the target number a lose is logged. When a win or lose is logged the game reloads and a new target is presented as well as new random numbers with the crystals and it can be played again.
